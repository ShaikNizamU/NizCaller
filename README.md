### üîÑ Use Your Own Firebase Key (For Other Users)

- They should:
  - Create your own Firebase project
  - Download your own `serviceAccountKey.json` as shown above
  - Replace the placeholder file in the project root

> ‚úÖ This allows you to send push notifications using **your own Firebase project** safely

### üîπ Step 2: Generate Access Token

Use the included script `getToken.js`:

```js
const { google } = require("googleapis");

const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
  keyFile: "./serviceAccountKey.json",
  scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.messaging"],
});

auth.getAccessToken().then(token => {
  console.log("‚úÖ Access Token:", token);
});


‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run it in terminal:

node getToken.js

This will print your access token. Copy it.


üì§ Send Push Notification (via Postman or cURL)
üî∏ Method
POST https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/messages:send
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your Firebase project ID.


üî∏ Headers
Key	            Value
Authorization	Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type	application/json


üî∏ Body (JSON)
{
  "message": {
    "token": "DEVICE_FCM_TOKEN_HERE",
    "notification": {
      "title": "Incoming Call",
      "body": "Shaik Nizam is calling..."
    },
    "data": {
      "type": "incoming_call"
    },
    "android": {
      "priority": "high",
      "notification": {
        "click_action": "FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK",
        "sound": "default"
      }
    }
  }
}

‚úÖ Once sent:

Notification will appear on the device

Tapping it will open the app

The app will play ringtone and show incoming call screen
